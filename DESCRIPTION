Description: SPM is a MATLAB software package implementing Statistical 
             Parametric Mapping for neuroimaging data 
             (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). This package
             has ported some of the core statistical routines of SPM
             to R. The goal is to be able to run a standard SPM analysis
             in R. This is convenient if MATLAB is not available (for
             example in a High Performance Computing environment) or if
             the SPM analysis is only part of a larger pipeline written
             in R.
Depends: R (>= 2.10.1), methods, Rniftilib
